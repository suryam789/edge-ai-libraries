# Document Summarization Sample Application

The Document Summarization Sample Application demonstrates how to leverage the LlamaIndex framework, a powerful framework for building applications with large language models (LLMs), to generate concise and informative summaries from long-form documents. By integrating LlamaIndex framework, the application efficiently processes and understands textual content, enabling users to extract key information and insights from a variety of document types. This approach streamlines content review, enhances searchability, and supports advanced use cases such as knowledge management and automated reporting.

The following are links to detailed documentation to help you get started, configure, and deploy the microservice.
